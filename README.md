**What is Forest Finder?**

Forest Finder is an R Shiny web app that allows users to dynamically
explore forested areas throughout California’s 58 counties. My original
goal in making this application was to strategically identify new
potential habitat where I could forage for edible mushroom (an activity
I look forward to doing when winter rains roll around). However, I
realized that it could serve many more purposes beyond just foraging. I
have since generalized the application to serve as a mapping resource
for nature enthusiasts to discover new forests for various outdoor
recreations such as backpacking and hiking, birding, hunting, or simply
just enjoying a walk in the woods. The purpose of Forest Finder is to
helps us connect to our local California forests and enrich our
interactions with wilderness. Regardless of how you use it, I appreciate
constructive feedback on how to improve the user experience, so please
contact me if you have questions or suggestions (email in the top right
corner). Forest Finder may grow, it may die, it may slowly evolve into
something that it wasn’t yesterday. I hope that it can serve you well as
it has for me.
